# EESA-Corpus

The EESA-Corpus is divided into train, dev, and test sets. Each set is provided as a CSV file with two columns: 
the first column contains the comment, and the second column contains its sentiment.

The train set includes 2,464 Arabic-English code-switched comments.
The dev and test sets each contain 818 comments.

Additionally, we provide the EESA-Lexicon, built from the EESA corpus. 
The EESA-Lexicon CSV file includes 2,324 positive and negative words and phrases, 
with each row listing a phrase and its corresponding sentiment polarity.
